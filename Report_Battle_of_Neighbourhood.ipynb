        "### In my project an attempt has been made to cluster the neighbourhood of city Mumbai (India). Mumbai is the heart of the country and millions of people come there every year for job opportunities and to make their dreams come true. Rightly quoted by many, it is the *Dream Capital of the Country*.<br><br> People travel many miles to commute to work and for various other activities, people tend to change their neighbourhood quite often, and who wants to leave their comfort zone. So, here a novel approach has been provided. <br><br> I have tried to cluster the various localities of the city, based on the different amenities in the close vicinity of the locality."
